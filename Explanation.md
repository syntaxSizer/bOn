# Big O notation
===================

What is the big O notation and why its called big O notation anyway ?

Big O notation: also called Landau's symbol, is a
symbolism used in complexity theory, computer science, and mathematics to describe the
asymptotic behavior of functions. Basically, it tells you how fast a function grows or
declines.

Landau's symbol comes from the name of the German number theoretician Edmund
Landau who invented the notation. The letter O is used because the rate of growth of a
function is also called its order

## notations                   name

### O(1)                       constant
### O(log(n))                  logarithmic
### O((log(n))^c)              polylogarithmic
### O(n)                       linear
### O(n^2)                     quadratic



# Undrestanding Big O
is a way to masure  how well a computer algorithm  scales as the amount of data involved incresses



# Order of one O(1)

O(1) excute in a constant  amount of time regardless of the amount of data

Example :
it i'll excute the same amount of time  10 array items or 10,000 array items


# order of n  O(n)
linear search
