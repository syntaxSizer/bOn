# Big O notation
===================

What is the big O notation and why its called big O notation anyway ?

Big O notation: also called Landau's symbol, is a
symbolism used in complexity theory, computer science, and mathematics to describe the
asymptotic behavior of functions. Basically, it tells you how fast a function grows or
declines.

Landau's symbol comes from the name of the German number theoretician Edmund
Landau who invented the notation. The letter O is used because the rate of growth of a
function is also called its order
